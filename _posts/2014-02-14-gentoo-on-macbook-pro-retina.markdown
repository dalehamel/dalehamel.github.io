After fighting with it a bit, I got gentoo working on my macbook retina from work. I updated the wiki article substantially to share my findings, in case anyone else wants to duplicate or improve on my efforts [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Apple\_Macbook\_Pro\_Retina](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Apple_Macbook_Pro_Retina "wiki article")
