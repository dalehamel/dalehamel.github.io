# Wordpress is dead. Long live Jekyll!

I'm going to start shutting down the old srvthe.net server, and I've already done away with the old wordpress server. It feels **really** good not to be runnyn any more php.
This site is now being hosted on github.io (ie, fastly). It took me a while to import the old posts and set up the redirects, but was surprisingly easy given the number of great resources out there.

For anyone looking to set up a simple blog I highly recommend Github.io + Jekyll. 

Interesting side note - I found out when I was almost done deploying the site that Jekyll uses Liquid, which was actually created by the CEO of Shopify, the company where I currently work.
