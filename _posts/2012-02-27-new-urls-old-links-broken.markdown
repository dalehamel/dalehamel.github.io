So, this was a long time coming, but the old url (prometheus.gotdns.com:88/wordpress) has been replaced with the current one.

If you have existing links, they are now broken.

I had been meaning to do this for a while, and only just got time to do so.

Really, I just wanted to get the blog up and running asap, so I didn't have the time to the URLS all nice. Now that they are all fixed up, they won't be changing again.
