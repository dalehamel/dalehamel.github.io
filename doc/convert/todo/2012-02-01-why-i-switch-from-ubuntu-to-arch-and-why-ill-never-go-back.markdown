<p>For a while, I was known pretty well exclusively as "that ubuntu geek". I would make my facebook pictures the most recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ubuntu_releases#Naming_convention" title="ubuntu animal">ubuntu animal</a>, and whenever someone would ask me for computer help... I'd install Ubuntu along side their Windows (for the next time that their winblows inevitably broke down).</p>

<p>And things were great, for a while. I liked Ubuntu, and Ubuntu seemed to like me.</p>

<p>And then, Ubuntu netbook remix came out - a dire sign of things to come. This would be the basis for their new UI using Unity desktop... an OS-X clone. The reasons why I left OS-X came flooding back to me. Also, I got tired of all the bloat that Ubuntu was throwing. Startup times were getting longer and longer, and an install/configure job would be a half day affair.</p>

<p>Enter Arch. Nice and light-weight, designed for developers. No package you don't want - no package you don't need. Want it? Install it. No package? Find a package build from the AUR, and just built it yourself.</p>

<p>Arch forces you to build your system from the ground up (providing you the necessary scaffolding and support as you do it - they also have an unbeatable wiki), rather than trimming off all the fat that Ubuntu crams down your throat. Now my system does exactly what I want, installs take no time at all, and boot-up is lightning fast. Not to mention arch's rolling release system, which means you can simply upgrade an existing system, rather than basically being forced to re-install a huge chunk of packages with Ubuntus iteration based released system.</p>

<p>With Ubuntu, I was a Linux user. With Arch, I'm a Linux <strong>developer</strong>.</p>
