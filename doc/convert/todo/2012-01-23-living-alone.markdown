<p>The entire time that I was growing up as a teenager, I had one singular goal - to move out as soon as possible!</p>

<p>Now, I've finally been able to make that dream come true. I'm even working my dream job right now, and everything is going great. Yet, there is still an emptiness. It is odd... no matter how much we have, it never seems to be enough. I remember when I was a kid, and I would have my mind set on some toy or gizmo that I really wanted. Once I got it, I would devote 100% of my time to it... for a few days. Then, it would be on to the next thing.</p>

<p>Funny how things never change.</p>

<p>I guess it comes down to wanting what you have, not just having what you want.</p>

<p>Oh god... the cliches are coming out... it must be late.</p>
