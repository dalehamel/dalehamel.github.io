  content: "Hello, I'm contacting you from SquirrelHosting.co.uk. We have created
    a guide which should help windows users install Rasplex. (http://squirrelhosting.co.uk/hosting-blog/hosting-blog-info.php?id=36
    ) This should help lower the amount of confused windows users trying to use the
    openelec guide.\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\nJonathan Proctor\r\np.s. I Look forward
    to playing with Rasplex on my own Pi."
