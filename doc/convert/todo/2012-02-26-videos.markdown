<p>This page contains some youtube videos that I've made.</p>

<h1>Kraid's Lair on an AtMega128</h1>

<p>This was done for an assignment for my Realtime Systems class. It was done on at AtMega128 microcontroller, written in scratch from C, and uses pulse-width modulation to synthesize notes read from the onboard flash memory. It was a really fun (and hard!) assignment, so I made this video.</p>

<p>The song that I synthesized is "Kraid's Lair", from the the old Nes metroid - my favorite classic game of all time.</p>

<h1>Genetic Pacman Simulation</h1>

<p>This was from a <a href="https://blog.srvthe.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/pdf_paperfinal.pdf" title="paper">paper</a> that I wrote as a term project for my intro AI class.</p>

<p>The paper describes (overviews) how Genetic Algorithms work, and uses a Pacman simulation as a case study for how they can be used to for learning behaviors.</p>

<p>The actual video is of a pacman who learned to survive the ghost and consume all of the pellets.</p>

<p>This was another fun (though the paper took forever to research and write) assignment. I have always had an interest in biology, and I find biologically and naturally inspired techniques.</p>

<h1>Mandelbrot Fractal</h1>

<p>So, this video is really old, from before I was even in Computer Science.</p>

<p>I have always found fractals, like all recursive algorithms, to be very interesting. I made this video years ago and posted it on youtube. It has actually had almost half a million views! I ended up making some money off of it, so I included it here.</p>

<p>Generating this video was my first lesson in asymptotic runtime.</p>
