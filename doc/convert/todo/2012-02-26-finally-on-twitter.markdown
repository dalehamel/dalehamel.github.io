<p>Well I've had a twitter account for a while, but I've been reluctant to actually make tweets.</p>

<p>I've been working to consolidate all of my web presence into one location (that I control, instead of something like facebook), and this is the next step.</p>

<p>So, hello twitterers!</p>

<p>Also, please follow me (dalehamel) now!</p>
