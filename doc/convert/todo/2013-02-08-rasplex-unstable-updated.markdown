<h1>Almost ready to release rasplex-0.1-a</h1>
I have created a release list on trello, with the planned features for theÂ <a href="https://trello.com/c/1oMwUL5L">rasplex-0.1-a release</a>.

I have uploaded a new snapshot to overwrite the <a href="http://rasplex.srvthe.net/rasplex-unstable.img.zip">existing unstable</a>, so that folks can play around with the fixes that have been added.

Notably:

&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><del>Updates still broken in this version, but fixed for 0.1-a</del></li>
	<li>libCEC SHOULD work, but i need someone to test it for me</li>
	<li>keyboard working again</li>
	<li>El added the ability to turn fan art on and off because he's amazing</li>
	<li>A metric tonne of GUI fixes thanks to Jsmith79 figuring out we can use OSX skin (working preferences pane!)</li>
	<li>You still have to copy your own advanced settings to get it to load (fixed for 0.1-a)</li>
	<li>No version number (will be one in 0.1-a)</li>
	<li>No autostart (there will be a command for 0.1-a)</li>
	<li>No avahi / airplay (will be in 0.1-a)</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

More extensive details when we get 0.1-a out, but for now this is for everyone that has been begging for a preview ;).
