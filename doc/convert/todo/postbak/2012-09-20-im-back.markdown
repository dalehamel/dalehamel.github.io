Finally back...
===============

After a very long break, my blog is finally back online and pretty much fully functionaly.

I've been pretty busy with a number of projects, not the least of which being my new job at Invenia, which have prevented me from posting on here much.

The old blog was also located on my home server, which presented several logistics problems...

I now have all of my servers consolidated into the amazon cloud.

What's coming?
==============

I plan on making quite a few posts about things I've learned about git, my switch to Gentoo, and my adventures with plex and the raspberry pi.

Stay tuned for more folks...
