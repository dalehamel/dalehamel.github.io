Almost ready to release rasplex-0.1-a
=====================================

I have created a release list on trello, with the planned features for the [rasplex-0.1-a release](https://trello.com/c/1oMwUL5L). I have uploaded a new snapshot to overwrite the [existing unstable](https://rasplex.srvthe.net/rasplex-unstable.img.zip), so that folks can play around with the fixes that have been added. Notably:  

-   ~~Updates still broken in this version, but fixed for 0.1-a~~
-   libCEC SHOULD work, but i need someone to test it for me
-   keyboard working again
-   El added the ability to turn fan art on and off because he's amazing
-   A metric tonne of GUI fixes thanks to Jsmith79 figuring out we can use OSX skin (working preferences pane!)
-   You still have to copy your own advanced settings to get it to load (fixed for 0.1-a)
-   No version number (will be one in 0.1-a)
-   No autostart (there will be a command for 0.1-a)
-   No avahi / airplay (will be in 0.1-a)

  More extensive details when we get 0.1-a out, but for now this is for everyone that has been begging for a preview ;).
