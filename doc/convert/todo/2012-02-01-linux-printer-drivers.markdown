<p>You know you are using linux when it takes you longer to find and install a printer driver that it did to write the thing you were trying to print. Total time spent writing essay: 35 minutes. Total time spent trying to find canon pixma mx310 compatible printer driver: 75 minutes.</p>

<p>Damnit cups!</p>
