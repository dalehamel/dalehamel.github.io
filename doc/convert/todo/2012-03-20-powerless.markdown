<p>Yesterday, there was a thunderstorm and the power went out. In then end, it was only a 2 hour power outage. I couldn't help but wonder though, what if it had been longer?</p>

<h1>In the dark</h1>

<p>At first, the power fluctuated, and I figured that there was probably just a surge, as my server rebooted and all of my clocks started to blink. Then, before my server even came back up, there was total darkness. I tried flipping some light switches - nothing. I looked out in the hallway, and saw the emergency lighting was on, as well as a few other confused faces poking their heads out of their doors. I looked out from my balcony, and I saw something I'd never seen before - all the lights, as far as I could see, were out.</p>

<p>This left me pretty bored. No computer, no streaming TV, no music - not even any 3G! I was completely cut off from the internet, everything was dark, and everything was quiet.</p>

<h1>It got me to thinking</h1>

<p>The moment when I realized that I literally couldn't do anything, I realized how much I depend on electricity. I am completely dependent on electricity and the modern era for my employment. I couldn't help but feel momentarily useless for a moment. What good is a computer science degree with no electricity? I now appreciate the modern era just a little bit more.</p>

<h1>Back online</h1>

<p>During the banal wait for the power company to get the juice flowing again, I figured I would at least try to find a way to kill the time. Thank goodness the LC was still open - I walked across the street (there was still power there), and bought some beer. I then waited on my balcony for the power to come on.</p>

<p>The sight of all of the lights suddenly flickering back on was like nothing I've ever seen before. All of a sudden, it was business as usual.</p>

<p>I'm not totally sure why, but this whole experience was fairly profound to me. I guess you don't really appreciate how much you need something until you can't take it for granted anymore.</p>

<p>I guess the whole ordeal helped me find a new appreciation for Manitoba Hydro.</p>
